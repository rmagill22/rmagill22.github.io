                When I turned thirteen my parents allowed me to adopt a kitten as my birthday present.

                I was very excited and after holding all the different kittens, I knew Penelope belonged with me. We instantly bonded and I have loved her ever since.

                I miss her dearly when I am away at school, but my mom regulary sends me photos of her. I still think she's the cutest cat in the world!
