                Both my mom and I have always wanted to adopt an orange cat. Since we are eventually planning on adopting two kittens, I think we will adopt an orange kitten first as the family cat, and then possibly a grey kitten later on when I move so that Penelope has a friend.

                We have several ideas for names, whether it be a male or female cat that we adopt.

                Some of our ideas for names are Ravioli, Buford, Velma, or Betty.
