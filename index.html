    <p>
      I have always been a fan of cats, and on my 13th birthday I was gifted one of my own! She is a tabby I adopted from the shelter and named Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first got Penelope, my family did not really like cats. However, they grew to love cats as much as I do and we plan to adopt a kitten in the coming months!
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to take Penelope with me when I move out, so my family wants to adopt a kitten to keep at home when I eventually leave. I also want to get Penelope a friend so she isn't lonely when I move out, so I think I'll adopt another kitten myself! This website is to show off Penelope, and examples of kittens I want to adopt.
