            <p>
                I have wanted a grey kitten for a long time. I think Penelope would look really cute with a grey kitten, and they would possibily even look related!

            <p>
                I am happy with either a male or female kitten. Either way I have ideas for names.

                Some of the names I have thought of are Cornelius, Cornelia, or Petunia.
